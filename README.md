# Remote Rift Website

Landing page for **Remote Rift**, an application that lets you queue for League of Legends games from your phone.

Visit the current version of the website at https://tomwyr.github.io/remote-rift-website.

## Development

The project uses **11ty (Eleventy)**, a popular static site generator. For more information, visit [11ty.dev](https://www.11ty.dev/).

To run the project locally:

1. Ensure Node.js is installed.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run `npm run serve`.
4. Open your browser at `http://localhost:8080`.

To modify the website content, edit the templates and data located under the `src` directory.  
After saving changes, 11ty automatically reloads the site to reflect the updates.

## Deployment

Deployment is handled via a GitHub Actions workflow that builds the static site and publishes it to GitHub Pages.  
See the workflow file: [.github/workflows/deploy_website.yml](.github/workflows/deploy_website.yml).

To release a new version, push changes to the `master` branch or [manually trigger the workflow](https://github.com/tomwyr/remote-rift-website/actions/workflows/deploy_website.yml) from GitHub.
